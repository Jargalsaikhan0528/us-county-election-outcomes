# US County-Level Election Analysis

## Project Title:
**The Impact of Social and Economic Factors on U.S. Election Outcomes at the County Level**

## Description
This project analyzes how various social and economic factors affect election outcomes in U.S. counties. The analysis integrates multiple datasets containing demographic, economic, and electoral data. Multiple data science techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, and machine learning models, are applied.

## Objective
- Investigate how economic indicators (e.g., GDP, unemployment) and social indicators (e.g., education, population composition) correlate with U.S. election outcomes.
- Build predictive models to assess the impact of these variables on voting behavior at the county level.

## Data Sources
- `county_census_and_election_result.csv` — Census and election data by county
- `GDP by County.csv` — County-level GDP data

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Repository Structure
- data/ # Raw datasets
- notebooks/ # Main analysis notebook
- README.md # Project documentation
- requirements.txt # Python dependencies
- .gitignore # Files to exclude from version control

## Results Summary
- Identified key economic and social predictors for election outcomes.
- Built regression/classification models to predict election results.
- Visualized correlations and key relationships between variables.

## Future Work
- Include more recent data.
- Add additional predictors (e.g., voter turnout, campaign spending).
